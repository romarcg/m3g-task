As a general rule, it is essential to consult a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you can advise your wife to avoid scratching the affected areas to prevent further irritation and promote healing. Over-the-counter anti-itch creams or ointments may also help alleviate the discomfort. If the itchiness and lumps persist or worsen, it is crucial to seek medical attention to rule out any serious underlying conditions. The image shows a close-up of a person's arm with white translucent lumps on it. The lumps appear to be raised and are located on the outer part of the arm. They seem to be growing in size and are accompanied by itchiness. As a dermatologist, I would first perform a thorough examination of the affected area to rule out any serious underlying conditions.

       "  'input': 'CONTEXTO: Lesión en la piel del dedo. Queridos hermanos y hermanas.  Tengo un problema muy molesto y espero que puedan ayudarme a resolverlo.  Gracias de antemano. \\nEstoy estudiando en Europa.  Allí trabajo a tiempo parcial en un restaurante chino.  Mis tareas incluyen: lavar vasos, ceniceros (no utilizo detergentes), servir mesas, etc.  Desde que empecé a trabajar, se me arranca la piel de las manos (véase la foto de abajo).  Al principio, va desgarrando la piel poco a poco, hasta que toda la zona con huella dactilar está completamente arrancada. (Primero el dedo anular, luego el dedo corazón y después el dedo índice).  Lo que queda se vuelve muy duro, áspero y empieza a agrietarse, a sangrar y a doler mucho.  La piel va saliendo capa a capa.  Esto causa grandes inconvenientes en mi vida diaria.  Si dejo de trabajar, se cura poco a poco.  El problema reaparece cuando vuelvo a trabajar.  Me pasa lo mismo aunque cambie de restaurante. \\nHe visitado a un dermatólogo aquí.  No me ha dicho nada especial, sólo me ha dicho que he usado demasiado jabón.  Me recetaron dos medicamentos. Uno para el día y otro para la noche.  El medicamento para el día contiene carbamida.  Me duele un poco al frotármelo en la mano, pero muestra cierta mejoría.  No sé mucho de la pomada para usar por la noche, pero no ayuda en absoluto.  No se quien me puede ayudar, diagnosticar la enfermedad y el tratamiento que necesita.\\nP.D. Tengo una amiga que tiene los mismos síntomas.  Ella me dijo que el problema se ha ido que después de tomar un medicamento con el nombre de Sporanox .  No estoy seguro de si debo tomar este medicamento.  Este medicamento no se puede comprar en la farmacia sin receta de un médico.\\nGracias de nuevo por la ayuda.\\n\\nANALISIS DE IMAGENES:  It is recommended to use traditional Chinese medicine for treatment, which can clear heat and dry dampness, and relieve itching by removing dampness.'},\n",
