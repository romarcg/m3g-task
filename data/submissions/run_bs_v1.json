Freckles are small, flat, and round patches of skin that are caused by an increased production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. They are common in fair-skinned individuals and tend to appear on areas of the body that are exposed to the sun, such as the face, back, shoulders, and upper arms. While they can sometimes develop into freckles, moles, or even skin cancer, they are generally not a cause for concern and will typically fade or disappear as the individual grows older."}]}]
