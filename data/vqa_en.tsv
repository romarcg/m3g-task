No obvious cause, and no specific time, could be very itchy at the leg.  There is a mass of lightly colored red rashes when starting.  It starts to get deeper in color and raise above skin surface, forming a bump.  It is itchy all the time.  Once scratching, it is expanding to a much larger area, with irregualr shape.
This picture shows 3 days after the onset of the disease.  The following shows the fourth day.  Look, it becomes more red in color, and starts to shrink in area.  The edge is getting clearer, and more shiny on the surface. A faint red spot in the middle can also be seen. The temperature of the affected area is getting higher, itchy......
Two days pass, it is starting to subside on the 6th day.  The red spot in the middle can be clearly seen, which is the place most itchy.
The 2 pictures following show the situation on the 7th day.  The 3rd batch is for the 9th day.  The small red spot is still there, but less itchy.
On the 17th day, there is not much feeling.  Yet it is still there, subsiding slowly, and not itchy any more.
3 months later, a few of them are coming up, all at the lower limbs, with one on the front left arm.  They are not that severe, not symmetrical, but very itchy.  Have tried loratadine and cetirizine and other topical creams, with not much effects.  I think this is Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction.

I am an overseas student in Europe.  I work part time at a Chinese restaurant there.  My duties include: washing glasses, ashtrays (I am not using detergents), waiting tables etc.  Right from the time I started working, my hands start to be torn out (see picture below).  At the very beginning, it is shredding skin little by little, until the whole area with finger print is completely off. (First from the ring finger, then the middle finger and then the index finger.)  What is left behind turn very hard, rough and it starts cracking, bleeding and very painful.  The skin is coming out layer by layer.  This causes great inconvenience to my daily life.  If I stop working, it heals gradually.  The problem comes back after I start working again.  It is the same even if I change to another restaurant. 

I have seen dermatologist here.  He/she didn't say anything special, just advised that I have been using too much soap.  I was prescribed two drugs. One for the day and another for the night.  The day time drug contains carbamide.  There is some minor pain when rubbing it onto my hand, but shows some improvement.  I don't know much for the ointment for use at night, but it is not helpful at all.  I don't know who can help me, telling me what disease it is, and what treatment is needed.

P.S.  I have a friend who has the same symptoms.  She told me the problem is gone that after taking a drug by the name of Sporanox .  I am not sure if I should take this drug.  Also this drug can not be purchased from pharmacy without prescription from a physician.
