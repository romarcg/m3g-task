Hope that physicians from all places could take a look.  Following is the history:-\n\nWork History:  Graduated in June, 2009.  Start working after that.  Work requires contact with  hydrochloric acid with low concentration inside a trench.  It is used to clean the oxidized surface of metal.  There is no use of protective gloves durig the process, and has direct contact with the hydrochloric acid.  Both hands are involved in the physical work, have direct contact with industrial grease.  Change of work place in March 2010.  Working in the office there, with occasional contact with metal.  Not sure it is caused by allergy with metal.\n\nSymptoms:  Blisters on the sides of both palms.  Very itchy.  If broken after scratching, liquid of light yellow in color is flowing out.  The more I scratch, the more is the itching.  Scab is forming after lesions.  Skin turns hard and starts shredding.  Mostly happening in Summer;  less serious in Winter.\n\nMedical History:\n1.  Diagnosis as eczema and epompholyx at the Dermatology Department of a local hospital.  Treatment is:  soaking in diluted Aluminum acetate solution, and topical use of Triamcinolone Acetonide Acetate and Miconazole Nitrate Neomycin Sulfate Cream.  No improvement after using them.\n2. Soaking in salicylic acid solution by myself.  Effect is not obvious.  Have tried that 5 times.\n3.  Topical use of Ketoconazole Ointment by myself.  Effect is not obvious.\n4.  Diagnosis as epompholyx at a county level hospital. Treatment: Soaking in boric acid solution; oral use of Loratadine and XTR (Xiatare) tablets; Topical use of Urea ointment for one week.  After that change to another antifungal ointment which I don't recall the name. Also prescribed by the physician at the time is Compound Camphor Cream for use when itchy.  With all these, I don't feel itchy at all.  Even if I drink alcohol, the itchiness is still very minimal.  Unfortunately the problem comes back afte 6 months.\n5. Soaking in Zuguang Powder+Pikangwang (A chinese herbal medicine containing Ketoconazole) every other night.  Yesterday was the 4 times.  The symptom is relieving a bit.  Skin is shredding, and becoming dry.  Topical use of Pikangwang is not very effective.\n\nEach of the treatment and use of medications mentioned above is spaced at least 2 months apart.  I would be very grateful if you guys can offer any help.  The disease is so troublesome to me.\nI smoke, and not particularly fond of drinking alcohol (except when I accompany my boss on events).  I am fond of eating spicy food.  However, because of the problem on my hands, I have cut back most of it.  The pictures below are downloaded from the internet.  My situations are quite similar to them.  My skin is thicker, and the area of skin shredding is also bigger as well.  When the weather is warm, I can feel there are numerous blisters below the skin.  It is itchy, more so if I scratch it.\n\n\n What is the skin disease shown in the photo? What is the best treatment?"

                "value": "Related to Eczema, pompholyx.  Request for diagnosis. Suffering eczema and epompholyx at hands from the year of 2010.  It is attacking me recurrently.  Very painful.  Hope that physicians from all places could take a look.  Following is the history:-\n\nWork History:  Graduated in June, 2009.  Start working after that.  Work requires contact with  hydrochloric acid with low concentration inside a trench.  It is used to clean the oxidized surface of metal.  There is no use of protective gloves durig the process, and has direct contact with the hydrochloric acid.  Both hands are involved in the physical work, have direct contact with industrial grease.  Change of work place in March 2010.  Working in the office there, with occasional contact with metal.  Not sure it is caused by allergy with metal.\n\nSymptoms:  Blisters on the sides of both palms.  Very itchy.  If broken after scratching, liquid of light yellow in color is flowing out.  The more I scratch, the more is the itching.  Scab is forming after lesions.  Skin turns hard and starts shredding.  Mostly happening in Summer;  less serious in Winter.\n\nMedical History:\n1.  Diagnosis as eczema and epompholyx at the Dermatology Department of a local hospital.  Treatment is:  soaking in diluted Aluminum acetate solution, and topical use of Triamcinolone Acetonide Acetate and Miconazole Nitrate Neomycin Sulfate Cream.  No improvement after using them.\n2. Soaking in salicylic acid solution by myself.  Effect is not obvious.  Have tried that 5 times.\n3.  Topical use of Ketoconazole Ointment by myself.  Effect is not obvious.\n4.  Diagnosis as epompholyx at a county level hospital. Treatment: Soaking in boric acid solution; oral use of Loratadine and XTR (Xiatare) tablets; Topical use of Urea ointment for one week.  After that change to another antifungal ointment which I don't recall the name. Also prescribed by the physician at the time is Compound Camphor Cream for use when itchy.  With all these, I don't feel itchy at all.  Even if I drink alcohol, the itchiness is still very minimal.  Unfortunately the problem comes back afte 6 months.\n5. Soaking in Zuguang Powder+Pikangwang (A chinese herbal medicine containing Ketoconazole) every other night.  Yesterday was the 4 times.  The symptom is relieving a bit.  Skin is shredding, and becoming dry.  Topical use of Pikangwang is not very effective.\n\nEach of the treatment and use of medications mentioned above is spaced at least 2 months apart.  I would be very grateful if you guys can offer any help.  The disease is so troublesome to me.\nI smoke, and not particularly fond of drinking alcohol (except when I accompany my boss on events).  I am fond of eating spicy food.  However, because of the problem on my hands, I have cut back most of it.  The pictures below are downloaded from the internet.  My situations are quite similar to them.  My skin is thicker, and the area of skin shredding is also bigger as well.  When the weather is warm, I can feel there are numerous blisters below the skin.  It is itchy, more so if I scratch it.\n\n\n What is the skin disease shown in the photo? What is the best treatment?"

Most \"papular urticaria\" cases are with children in the rural areas.  Have recommended that parents take their sick child to the city.  Feedback from parents that the disease is healed after a few days.  So I recalled that my teacher told me that popular urticaria is related to the environment.\n2.        Patients of recurrent cases are thin and unhealthy, along with pityriasis simplex.  Recommend to get rid of roundworms, the occurrences have decreased.  With that, I think of saying of parasitic diseases in intestines in Chinese Medicine. \n3.        It is easier to get the disease again if there are pets in the family.  Recommend to eradicate the bugs, and the patient wouldl heal by themselves.  So I think of disease caused by bug bite in the text book.\n4.        Recurrence is more serious for people fond of seafood, glutinous rice and eggs.  So I think of the theory of abnormal reaction and dysfunction of the GI tract.\n\nSummarizing the above, I would recommend:\na.        Pay attention to personal hygiene.  Bath and change of clothing frequently, diligent in Manicure, to avoid infection.\nb.        Treat parasites in the GI tract timely; enhance your body\u2019s immunity.\nc.        Eradicate bugs, fleas, mites and insects.\nd.        Condition your diet.\ne.         Use of drugs:\ni.        Zentel tablets.  Taken orally 2 tablets.\nii.        Jointly use of H1 receptor antagonists and H2 receptor antagonists.\niii.        Calcium Supplements\niv.     Use of Astringents and glucocorticoids topically.\n\n"

Most \"papular urticaria\" cases are with children in the rural areas.  Have recommended that parents take their sick child to the city.  Feedback from parents that the disease is healed after a few days.  So I recalled that my teacher told me that popular urticaria is related to the environment.\n2.        Patients of recurrent cases are thin and unhealthy, along with pityriasis simplex.  Recommend to get rid of roundworms, the occurrences have decreased.  With that, I think of saying of parasitic diseases in intestines in Chinese Medicine. \n3.        It is easier to get the disease again if there are pets in the family.  Recommend to eradicate the bugs, and the patient wouldl heal by themselves.  So I think of disease caused by bug bite in the text book.\n4.        Recurrence is more serious for people fond of seafood, glutinous rice and eggs.  So I think of the theory of abnormal reaction and dysfunction of the GI tract.\n\nSummarizing the above, I would recommend:\na.        Pay attention to personal hygiene.  Bath and change of clothing frequently, diligent in Manicure, to avoid infection.\nb.        Treat parasites in the GI tract timely; enhance your body\u2019s immunity.\nc.        Eradicate bugs, fleas, mites and insects.\nd.        Condition your diet.\ne.         Use of drugs:\ni.        Zentel tablets.  Taken orally 2 tablets.\nii.        Jointly use of H1 receptor antagonists and H2 receptor antagonists.\niii.        Calcium Supplements\niv.     Use of Astringents and glucocorticoids topically.\n\n"

Treatment:  Obese people should bath regularly and use drying powder to dry up the body.  Treatment should be the same as having tinea corporis.  Because skin at the groin area is very delicate, should not use strong drug to affect the skin.  Generally should use Resorcinol cream or 1% Econazole or Clotrimazole cream, 2 % miconazole, bifonazole, ketoconazole, sertafurazole, butenafine, terbinafine cream are also O.K.  \nOrally, the use of Flavomycin is rather effective.  But it could easily relapse after stopping the medication.  So it is not recommended. Fluconazol, Itraconazole, Terbinafine etc may be used in short term.\nCause of the disease\nCommonly caused by flocculent epidermal tinea, trichophyton, and red trichophyton.  Sometimes, invasion to the groin area by Candida albicans resulting in red scaling of skin.  May have papulovesicle at the edge.  This disease can happen easily in the humid season, mostly with male who are sweating a lot.  Workers in specific disciplines  such as drivers and people who are in sitting position for extended period of time could contract this disease easily.\n\n2. clinical manifestation\nOften occurring at the skin opposite to the scrotum, on one side or both.  Mostly exhibiting in a circle or semi-circle rash.  Initially growing as a small patch of rash on the inside of the upper part of the buttock.  There is scaling and spreading to all sides.  The border / edge is rather clear.  On top of it, it has blisters, lumps, and scab.  The central part of it can be healing by itself with scaling and pigment decomposition.  After some time, part of the skin could be thickening and lichenified, along with itchiness.  In serious cases, it can spread to the inner side of the buttock, perineum and its surroundings.  The lower side of rash is rather clear.  Sometimes, it could also affect the scrotum and its root area.\n\n3. Diagnosis:  It can be diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and test on fungal infection.  Diagnosis to determine to disease should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\nDefinition of Fungus\n\nFungus is a living creature with real nucleus.  The most common fungus is the mushrooms.  In addition, it also includes Mold and yeast.  There are more than 70,000 kinds of fungus.  It is believed that this only constitutes a small part of the fungus. Originally most fungus is classified as plant or animal.\nAt present, fungus has been classified separately from animal or plant, and forms its own realm in parallel with Animal, Plant, Prokaryotic and Protobiotic Realms. It has a strong cell wall and a real nucleus.  It does not have chlorophyll and is heterotrophic.  Typically, it can be reproduced asexually and sexually, producing spores in various forms.  Based on the characteristics of its growth and difference in physical appearances, it can be separated as yeast, fungus and mushrooms.  Among them, 300 or so could cause diseases. With the exception of Cryptococcus and mushrooms, most of the disease causing fungi are mold medically.  Based on the locations of human body being invaded by fungus, clinically it can be separated into superficial fungal infection and deep fungal infection. Fungal enteritis is a deep fungal infection. Superficial fungal infection invades skin, hair and nail.  Deep fungal infection can invade body skin, mucosa, deep tissues and internal organs, and may result in disseminated hyperinfection of the whole body. Deep fungal infection at the intestines is fungal enteritis. May also appear in babies as candida enteritis, or fungal infection to the whole body, such as Histoplasmosis being a complication with AIDS.\n\n\n\n"

                "value": "Diagnosis to determine to disease:  Should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\n5. Treatment:  Obese people should bath regularly and use drying powder to dry up the body.  Treatment should be the same as having tinea corporis.  Because skin at the groin area is very delicate, should not use strong drug to affect the skin.  Generally should use Resorcinol cream or 1% Econazole or Clotrimazole cream, 2 % miconazole, bifonazole, ketoconazole, sertafurazole, butenafine, terbinafine cream are also O.K.  \nOrally, the use of Flavomycin is rather effective.  But it could easily relapse after stopping the medication.  So it is not recommended. Fluconazol, Itraconazole, Terbinafine etc may be used in short term.\nCause of the disease\nCommonly caused by flocculent epidermal tinea, trichophyton, and red trichophyton.  Sometimes, invasion to the groin area by Candida albicans resulting in red scaling of skin.  May have papulovesicle at the edge.  This disease can happen easily in the humid season, mostly with male who are sweating a lot.  Workers in specific disciplines  such as drivers and people who are in sitting position for extended period of time could contract this disease easily.\n\n2. clinical manifestation\nOften occurring at the skin opposite to the scrotum, on one side or both.  Mostly exhibiting in a circle or semi-circle rash.  Initially growing as a small patch of rash on the inside of the upper part of the buttock.  There is scaling and spreading to all sides.  The border / edge is rather clear.  On top of it, it has blisters, lumps, and scab.  The central part of it can be healing by itself with scaling and pigment decomposition.  After some time, part of the skin could be thickening and lichenified, along with itchiness.  In serious cases, it can spread to the inner side of the buttock, perineum and its surroundings.  The lower side of rash is rather clear.  Sometimes, it could also affect the scrotum and its root area.\n\n3. Diagnosis:  It can be diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and test on fungal infection.  Diagnosis to determine to disease should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\nDefinition of Fungus\n\nFungus is a living creature with real nucleus.  The most common fungus is the mushrooms.  In addition, it also includes Mold and yeast.  There are more than 70,000 kinds of fungus.  It is believed that this only constitutes a small part of the fungus. Originally most fungus is classified as plant or animal.\nAt present, fungus has been classified separately from animal or plant, and forms its own realm in parallel with Animal, Plant, Prokaryotic and Protobiotic Realms. It has a strong cell wall and a real nucleus.  It does not have chlorophyll and is heterotrophic.  Typically, it can be reproduced asexually and sexually, producing spores in various forms.  Based on the characteristics of its growth and difference in physical appearances, it can be separated as yeast, fungus and mushrooms.  Among them, 300 or so could cause diseases. With the exception of Cryptococcus and mushrooms, most of the disease causing fungi are mold medically.  Based on the locations of human body being invaded by fungus, clinically it can be separated into superficial fungal infection and deep fungal infection. Fungal enteritis is a deep fungal infection. Superficial fungal infection invades skin, hair and nail.  Deep fungal infection can invade body skin, mucosa, deep tissues and internal organs, and may result in disseminated hyperinfection of the whole body. Deep fungal infection at the intestines is fungal enteritis. May also appear in babies as candida enteritis, or fungal infection to the whole body, such as Histoplasmosis being a complication with AIDS.\n\n\n\n"

Treatment:  Obese people should bath regularly and use drying powder to dry up the body.  Treatment should be the same as having tinea corporis.  Because skin at the groin area is very delicate, should not use strong drug to affect the skin.  Generally should use Resorcinol cream or 1% Econazole or Clotrimazole cream, 2 % miconazole, bifonazole, ketoconazole, sertafurazole, butenafine, terbinafine cream are also O.K.  \nOrally, the use of Flavomycin is rather effective.  But it could easily relapse after stopping the medication.  So it is not recommended. Fluconazol, Itraconazole, Terbinafine etc may be used in short term.\nCause of the disease\nCommonly caused by flocculent epidermal tinea, trichophyton, and red trichophyton.  Sometimes, invasion to the groin area by Candida albicans resulting in red scaling of skin.  May have papulovesicle at the edge.  This disease can happen easily in the humid season, mostly with male who are sweating a lot.  Workers in specific disciplines  such as drivers and people who are in sitting position for extended period of time could contract this disease easily.\n\n2. clinical manifestation\nOften occurring at the skin opposite to the scrotum, on one side or both.  Mostly exhibiting in a circle or semi-circle rash.  Initially growing as a small patch of rash on the inside of the upper part of the buttock.  There is scaling and spreading to all sides.  The border / edge is rather clear.  On top of it, it has blisters, lumps, and scab.  The central part of it can be healing by itself with scaling and pigment decomposition.  After some time, part of the skin could be thickening and lichenified, along with itchiness.  In serious cases, it can spread to the inner side of the buttock, perineum and its surroundings.  The lower side of rash is rather clear.  Sometimes, it could also affect the scrotum and its root area.\n\n3. Diagnosis:  It can be diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and test on fungal infection.  Diagnosis to determine to disease should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\nDefinition of Fungus\n\nFungus is a living creature with real nucleus.  The most common fungus is the mushrooms.  In addition, it also includes Mold and yeast.  There are more than 70,000 kinds of fungus.  It is believed that this only constitutes a small part of the fungus. Originally most fungus is classified as plant or animal.\nAt present, fungus has been classified separately from animal or plant, and forms its own realm in parallel with Animal, Plant, Prokaryotic and Protobiotic Realms. It has a strong cell wall and a real nucleus.  It does not have chlorophyll and is heterotrophic.  Typically, it can be reproduced asexually and sexually, producing spores in various forms.  Based on the characteristics of its growth and difference in physical appearances, it can be separated as yeast, fungus and mushrooms.  Among them, 300 or so could cause diseases. With the exception of Cryptococcus and mushrooms, most of the disease causing fungi are mold medically.  Based on the locations of human body being invaded by fungus, clinically it can be separated into superficial fungal infection and deep fungal infection. Fungal enteritis is a deep fungal infection. Superficial fungal infection invades skin, hair and nail.  Deep fungal infection can invade body skin, mucosa, deep tissues and internal organs, and may result in disseminated hyperinfection of the whole body. Deep fungal infection at the intestines is fungal enteritis. May also appear in babies as candida enteritis, or fungal infection to the whole body, such as Histoplasmosis being a complication with AIDS.\n\n\n\n"

                "value": "Diagnosis to determine to disease:  Should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\n5. Treatment:  Obese people should bath regularly and use drying powder to dry up the body.  Treatment should be the same as having tinea corporis.  Because skin at the groin area is very delicate, should not use strong drug to affect the skin.  Generally should use Resorcinol cream or 1% Econazole or Clotrimazole cream, 2 % miconazole, bifonazole, ketoconazole, sertafurazole, butenafine, terbinafine cream are also O.K.  \nOrally, the use of Flavomycin is rather effective.  But it could easily relapse after stopping the medication.  So it is not recommended. Fluconazol, Itraconazole, Terbinafine etc may be used in short term.\nCause of the disease\nCommonly caused by flocculent epidermal tinea, trichophyton, and red trichophyton.  Sometimes, invasion to the groin area by Candida albicans resulting in red scaling of skin.  May have papulovesicle at the edge.  This disease can happen easily in the humid season, mostly with male who are sweating a lot.  Workers in specific disciplines  such as drivers and people who are in sitting position for extended period of time could contract this disease easily.\n\n2. clinical manifestation\nOften occurring at the skin opposite to the scrotum, on one side or both.  Mostly exhibiting in a circle or semi-circle rash.  Initially growing as a small patch of rash on the inside of the upper part of the buttock.  There is scaling and spreading to all sides.  The border / edge is rather clear.  On top of it, it has blisters, lumps, and scab.  The central part of it can be healing by itself with scaling and pigment decomposition.  After some time, part of the skin could be thickening and lichenified, along with itchiness.  In serious cases, it can spread to the inner side of the buttock, perineum and its surroundings.  The lower side of rash is rather clear.  Sometimes, it could also affect the scrotum and its root area.\n\n3. Diagnosis:  It can be diagnosed based on clinical manifestation and test on fungal infection.  Diagnosis to determine to disease should distinguish among erythrasma, seborrheic dermatitis, Proliferative pemphigus,  and Erosive Psoriasis.\n\nDefinition of Fungus\n\nFungus is a living creature with real nucleus.  The most common fungus is the mushrooms.  In addition, it also includes Mold and yeast.  There are more than 70,000 kinds of fungus.  It is believed that this only constitutes a small part of the fungus. Originally most fungus is classified as plant or animal.\nAt present, fungus has been classified separately from animal or plant, and forms its own realm in parallel with Animal, Plant, Prokaryotic and Protobiotic Realms. It has a strong cell wall and a real nucleus.  It does not have chlorophyll and is heterotrophic.  Typically, it can be reproduced asexually and sexually, producing spores in various forms.  Based on the characteristics of its growth and difference in physical appearances, it can be separated as yeast, fungus and mushrooms.  Among them, 300 or so could cause diseases. With the exception of Cryptococcus and mushrooms, most of the disease causing fungi are mold medically.  Based on the locations of human body being invaded by fungus, clinically it can be separated into superficial fungal infection and deep fungal infection. Fungal enteritis is a deep fungal infection. Superficial fungal infection invades skin, hair and nail.  Deep fungal infection can invade body skin, mucosa, deep tissues and internal organs, and may result in disseminated hyperinfection of the whole body. Deep fungal infection at the intestines is fungal enteritis. May also appear in babies as candida enteritis, or fungal infection to the whole body, such as Histoplasmosis being a complication with AIDS.\n\n\n\n"
